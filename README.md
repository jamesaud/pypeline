# pypeline
a docker pipeline in python - clone from git, build docker image, run tests in docker containers, push to docker repo.

clone: 
>git clone https://github.cerner.com/JA048043/pypeline

install (make sure pip is installed): 
>cd pypeline
>sudo python3 setup.py install

Currently, you must do the full import to run the code. Open a python3.5 file and test:
>from pypeline.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline

Copy the code from 'example_pipe.py' and see how it works.
