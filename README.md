# pypeline
a docker pipeline in python

I haven't written all the tests yet. Use cases are in example.py. Clone and run example_pipe.py and example_rails.py to see it in action.
example_rails.py automates the pipeline process specifically for rails apps.

There is still a lot to be done including many more tests and login credentials for dockerhub
